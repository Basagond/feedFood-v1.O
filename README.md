# feedFood-v1.O


        feedFood is an iOS App that puts surplus food to the best use. It helps one to share his excess food to people who are in need. We approach the issue of hunger with a sharing-economy model: the donation of excess food enables a vital, yet often wasted, resource to be used to its full capacity. For example, a Donor - has leftover food in either their cafeteria or following a work or any family related event. Donor could request a food pickup via feedFood and we would match the surplus food to a nearby NGO's in need and send notification to NGOs, NGOs can communicate with Donor using chat or call option then they can collect the surplus.
